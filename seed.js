We all knew this day was coming, that he would die, but the finality of it has been a bit difficult to accept.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Now I understand what my father meant many years ago. He said that when Joe Louis died he felt that he lost a little bit of himself. Louis had helped frame the ethos of my father&#x2019;s generation of black men and women as Ali helped frame mine.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Louis&#x2019;s warning to his opponents summed up the determination of my father&#x2019;s generation: You can run, but you can&#x2019;t hide.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Ali told us to float like butterflies and sting like bees.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">We all have the heroes and legends of our youth. I am forever grateful that the athlete I most respected and admired taught me the realities of life in the United States. That being an active, conscious black person in America meant traveling a road where wealth and trinkets would test the will of men and women of principle.</p><figure id=\"media-100000004455363\" class=\"media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000004455363 ratio-tall\">\n    \n    <div class=\"image\">\n            <img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/07/sports/07RHODENweb2/07RHODENweb2-superJumbo.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"media-viewer-candidate\">\n            <meta value=\"462\">\n            <meta value=\"675\">\n    </div>\n        <figcaption class=\"caption\">\n                <span class=\"caption-text\">Ali battled George Foreman in Zaire in 1974.</span>\n                        \n            </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Gentrification is on my mind because I live in Harlem and have watched as this and other previously black neighborhoods around the country are being gobbled up and transformed from black to nonblack.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Black homeowners, eschewing neighborhood and community, sell for million-dollar trinkets.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Ali never sold.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-2\">I was a high school junior when he was stripped of his heavyweight title. When his championship belt was taken, Ali effectively said that it was a mere trinket, nothing compared to the principle he was being asked to relinquish.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">I loved that and would try &#x2014; sometimes succeeding, sometimes not &#x2014; to live by that ideal.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">I met Ali for the first time in the 1970s while working at Ebony magazine. The year I arrived at Ebony, Ali pulled off the greatest boxing upset I have ever seen. He knocked out the seemingly invincible, previously undefeated George Foreman in Zaire.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Two of Ali&#x2019;s three fights against Joe Frazier were classics, but the victory over Foreman was transformative. For Foreman, it was life-altering.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">I never spoke to Ali about the Foreman fight but I spoke plenty about it with Foreman. He was devastated and eventually would take a 10-year hiatus from boxing. Foreman said he had a religious revelation. I think the revelation was Ali, and everything he stood for.</p><figure id=\"muhammad-ali-coverage\" class=\"interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-sub-medium\">\n    \n    \n    <figcaption class=\"interactive-caption\">\n            \n            </figcaption>\n\n        \n    \n    \n</figure>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">It was during that period that my friend Gregg Simms, then the sports editor at Jet magazine, called me one afternoon and asked if I wanted to go to Ali&#x2019;s house.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Of course I did.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">But once inside his house, in the presence of an athlete I held in such high regard, I wasn&#x2019;t sure what to say, and said nothing. I just stood there.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Life went on. In September 1976, I covered Ali&#x2019;s third match against Ken Norton, at Yankee Stadium. Two years later, I left Ebony to become a feature writer and jazz critic for The Baltimore Sun and, from there, joined The New York Times in 1982. By that point, the impact Ali had made on my life &#x2013; the strong belief I now had that black athletes needed to express themselves politically &#x2013; was set.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">I was in Atlanta for the 1996 Summer Games when Ali lit the Olympic torch and seemed to set the world on fire. Two years later, I was at the United Nations when then Secretary General Kofi Annan presented Ali with the Messenger of Peace award.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-3\">In 2005 I was in Louisville for the dedication of the Muhammad Ali Center. In each of these instances, the toll that Parkinson&#x2019;s disease was taking on Ali was becoming increasingly evident. Still, Ali kept up a grueling schedule. After the Louisville event, for example, he was scheduled to fly to Germany to receive an award. I asked his wife, Lonnie, why Ali kept traveling. Why he subjected himself to the grind. She said: &#x201C;People always ask: &#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t he tired?&#x2019; Shouldn&#x2019;t he rest?&#x2019; Muhammad says, &#x2018;I got plenty of time to rest.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">My last real exchange with Ali came at the Sydney Olympics, in 2000, during a reception. By now, his Parkinson&#x2019;s disease had progressed to the point that you really had to strain to make out his words. Yet Ali was in great form.</p><figure id=\"media-100000004455365\" class=\"media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000004455365 ratio-tall\">\n    \n    <div class=\"image\">\n            <img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/07/sports/07RHODENweb3/07RHODENweb3-superJumbo.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"media-viewer-candidate\">\n            <meta value=\"450\">\n            <meta value=\"675\">\n    </div>\n        <figcaption class=\"caption\">\n                <span class=\"caption-text\">Andrew Hale and his daughter Chloe, 3, at a makeshift memorial at the Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville.</span>\n                        \n            </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Asked how it felt to light the Olympic torch four years earlier, Ali said: &#x201C;Scary as hell. My left hand was shaking because of Parkinson&#x2019;s, my right hand was shaking from fear. Somehow, between the two of them, I got the thing lit.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">When someone asked him to name his toughest foe, Ali said: &#x201C;U.S. military. Next toughest fight was my first wife.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Later, in his hotel room, I was speaking with Ali when he looked at me and asked: &#x201C;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201D;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Of course he knew my name, but he wanted to make a larger point.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#x201C;Bill Rhoden,&#x201D; I said, knowing what was coming.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s not your name. That&#x2019;s your slave name.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">He talked for another 15 minutes about racism and oppression and history.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">What I gleaned from Ali&#x2019;s life, as I lived mine, is that the goal is not to go through life undefeated. The quest is to exercise resilience and come back stronger.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Beloved by much of the world, Ali nonetheless was consistently, unapologetically black.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">I loved that about him.

Right now, they sure seem unstoppable.</p>\n<p>Green had 28 points, seven rebounds and five assists, while MVP Stephen Curry scored 18 points despite foul trouble, and Golden State thoroughly overwhelmed the Cleveland Cavaliers 110-77 in Game 2 of the NBA Finals on Sunday night.</p>\n<p>The 33-point win was the Warriors' most lopsided ever in a finals game.</p>\n<p>\"I'm definitely surprised at the margin of victory tonight,\" coach Steve Kerr said. \"It happens in the NBA, sometimes things get away from you. Sometimes shots go in, sometimes they don't. ... Everything changes when we go to Cleveland, we know that.\"</p>\n<p>Once the Splash Brothers found their shooting touch, Cleveland couldn't keep up. Klay Thompson got hot after halftime to finish with 17 points and five assists as Golden State became the first team to go ahead 2-0 in the finals since the Lakers in 2009 against Orlando.</p>\n<p>\"What we've done the last few years, everybody, every night has an impact,\" Curry said. \"You don't know where it's going to come from any given night. We've got to keep our focus and our edge and hopefully get two more.\"</p>\n<p>Now, the series shifts to Cleveland, and LeBron James and the Cavs must show up for Game 3 on Wednesday in front of their title-starved fans down 2-0 to the defending champs and with forward Kevin Love dealing with a head injury.</p>\n<p>The NBA said Love experienced dizziness early in the second half and left for the locker room to be re-examined, then was placed in the NBA's concussion protocol. The league said he didn't exhibit any symptoms before then, even after taking an elbow to the back of the head from Harrison Barnes in the second quarter and going down for several minutes before returning following a timeout. He made a baseline 3-pointer for the Cavs' first basket in nearly 5 minutes.</p>\n<p>After a scoreless first quarter when he missed all five shots but had five assists, James scored 14 of his 19 points in the second and also finished with nine assists and eight rebounds, but seven turnovers. James' teams had won nine straight postseason Game 2s after losing the series opener dating back to a loss in the 2008 Eastern Conference semifinals to Boston.</p>\n<p>After Curry and Thompson combined for only 20 points in Thursday's 104-89 Game 1 win on 8-for-27 shooting and the bench carried the load, they each hit four 3-pointers and went 13 for 24.</p>\n<p>Leandro Barbosa had three straight transition layups in the third quarter and scored 10 points for his first back-to-back postseason games in double figures since 2008.</p>\n<p>The Warriors' 87 victories combined from their record 73-win regular season and the playoffs matched the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls, the group Golden State topped for the most regular season victories in NBA history of 73.</p>\n<p>Andrew Bogut had four of his five blocks -- Golden State had nine overall -- in the first 7:15 and received a standing ovation when he came out at 3:50 in the first then went to the locker room late in the quarter. He hit his hand on the rim early and grimaced in pain.</p>\n<p><strong>Ouch</strong><br>Andre Iguodala, the 2015 finals MVP, took another hard hit to the groin in the first quarter on an offensive foul called against James, causing the Warriors forward to grimace in pain. Matthew Dellavedova got Iguodala in the same area in Game 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Remembering the Greatest</strong><br>A moment of silence was held for late boxing great Muhammad Ali, who died Friday night at an Arizona hospital. Photos of Ali showed on the main scoreboard ahead of the national anthem.</p>\n<p><strong>Tip-ins</strong><br><em>Cavaliers:</em> James' career-best 25 straight postseason games scoring 20 or more points was snapped. ... James played in his 194th postseason game, passing Karl Malone and Danny Ainge (193 each) for 10th place on the career list. His first-quarter steal also moved James past John Stockton (338) at fourth place for career postseason steals.</p>\n<p><em>Warriors:</em> Bogut's four blocks in the first were the most in one finals quarter since Ben Wallace's five for Detroit during Game 3 against San Antonio in 2005. ... Green became the fourth player in Warriors history with 500 rebounds in the postseason, joining Wilt Chamberlain, Nate Thurmond and Clyde Lee. Green also has a steal in 20 straight playoff games. ... Golden State is 3-5 all-time in Game 2 of the NBA Final and 3-2 at home, including a 95-93 overtime loss to the Cavs last year. ... The Warriors committed six turnovers in the first quarter alone after having only nine all of Game 1.</p>\n  </div>\n  \n\n  \n  \n</div>",

The Waif stabs Arya in the stomach, Arya escapes into some water -- and then nothing.</p>\n<p>Asked whether Arya is in any real trouble, \"Game of Thrones\" co-executive producer Bryan Cogman <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/article/2016/06/05/game-thrones-the-hound-interview\" target=\"_blank\">told Entertainment Weekly</a>:&#xA0;\"Yes. She defied the Faceless Men once, and now she does it twice. She&#x2019;s been well-trained, but she&#x2019;s up against [professional killers].\"</p>\n<p>All signs say a girl is in serious doo-doo ... or is she?</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\"><p>A scene in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIOiAfEIk_g\" target=\"_blank\">preview for Episode 8</a>, which also appeared in the Season 6 trailer,&#xA0;shows Arya looking pretty spry as she leaps from a rooftop --&#xA0;possibly being chased by the Waif. (If this were a Tony Hawk video game, we'd all be talking about the massive air she gets on that jump.)</p>\n<p>Besides that, we've already seen a number of clues that Arya is making it back to Westeros this season. Remember&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/carice-van-houten-melisandre-necklace_us_572a32b5e4b016f3789461fd\">Melisandre</a>'s foreshadowing back in Season 3 when she stated: \"I see a darkness in you. And, in that darkness, eyes staring back at me. Brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes ... eyes you'll shut forever. We will meet again.\"</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\"><p>The \"eyes\" part could allude to all the people Arya will kill, but the most important bit here is the suggestion that Arya and Mel will meet up again. (And probably have another super-weird conversation.)</p>\n<p>So, look on the bright side, Arya -- you've got that to look forward to. (Sorry.)</p>\n<p>Recent interviews also indicate that Arya will return to Westeros and become a <em>lady</em> with a <em>stone</em>-cold demeanor and a <em>heartless</em> way of doing things. OK&#xA0;... what we're trying to say is that she'll become&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/this-theory-proves-lady-stoneheart-is-coming-to-game-of-thrones_us_574dc491e4b02912b240e15e\">Lady Stoneheart</a>.</p>\n<p>To a lesser extent, there's also evidence that <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-theory-arya_us_57541ae4e4b0ed593f14ab46\">Arya and the Waif are the same person</a>, which actually seems to be supported by some of Cogman's other comments to EW. The producer said Arya's story is part of an \"ongoing arc\" in which she's \"battling her own humanity and her reasons for being part of this guild\" of Faceless Men. That could easily fit with Arya battling a split-personality disorder.</p>\n<p>It's also strange that Arya would not be on the lookout for people coming after her. Something weird is going on, and it seems clear that Arya will soon be back in action.</p>\n<p>But, above all, here's what the show needs to give us:</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\"><p>HBO, do you even realize howl much we need this reunion?</p>\n<p>Without it, life would be ruff.</p>\n<p><em>\"Game of Thrones\" Season 6 airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO.</em></p></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<section class=\"extra-content\">\n<h4 class=\"extra-content__title\">Also on HuffPost:</h4>\n<div class=\"extra-content__media\">\n\n<div class=\"slideshow\" id=\"slideshow-569400c7e4b0cad15e65ae67\">\n<div class=\"slideshow__preview\">\n\n<div class=\"slideshow__preview__text\">\n<p class=\"slideshow__preview__text__title\">How To Pronounce The Names Of \"Game Of Thrones\" Characters</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n</div>\n</section>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"tag-cloud\">\n<h2>More:</h2>\n<a class=\"tag\" href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/game-of-thrones/\">Game Of Thrones</a> <a class=\"tag\" href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/entertainment-originals/\">Entertainment Originals</a> <a class=\"tag\" href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/arya/\">Arya</a>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n</div>",

Weill</a>, then the chief of Citigroup, set up an offshore account called April Fool for his yacht. Alfonso Soriano, a former Major League Baseball All-Star player with the Yankees and other teams, had a Panamanian corporation created for him. John E. Akridge III, a leading real estate developer in Washington, flew to Panama to meet with Mossack Fonseca lawyers, who in 2011 created the Cyclops Family Foundation in Panama, along with a related bank account.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">A spokesman for Mr. Weill said the accounts were used for legitimate purposes, and &#x201C;appropriate disclosures were filed.&#x201D; Mr. Akridge and Mr. Soriano did not respond to repeated requests for comment.</p> <figure id=\"document-ponsoldt-mossack-fonseca\" class=\"interactive promo  layout-small\">\n        <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/06/03/us/document-ponsoldt-mossack-fonseca.html\">\n        \n        <div class=\"interactive-image-container\">\n            <div class=\"interactive-image\">\n                <img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/06/us/06panama-document-promo-ponsoldt/06panama-document-promo-ponsoldt-master180.png\">\n            </div>\n            <p class=\"interactive-overlay\">\n                <i class=\"icon sprite-icon interactive-overlay-icon\"></i>\n                                <span class=\"interactive-overlay-text\">\n                    OPEN Document                </span>\n                            </p>\n        </div>\n\n                \n            </a>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">For its best customers, like the Ponsoldts, who declined repeated requests to discuss their work with Mossack Fonseca, the firm&#x2019;s ministrations went far beyond legal services and banking. It acted as a concierge for &#x201C;all details regarding your properties and worldwide business affairs,&#x201D; for example, helping the family confidentially purchase (and dispose of) luxury condominiums at resort destinations and even arranging repairs for a car stored at a vacation home and hiring a contractor to fix broken poolside tiles, the documents show.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#x201C;You deserve the best Mr. Ponsoldt, and we will try to help you the most we can,&#x201D; the firm explained in an email.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The firm&#x2019;s American clients often expressed disbelief at how much they could lighten their tax burden by using the techniques advocated by Mossack Fonseca.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#x201C;At hearing that he can make nearly $8 million per year just on tax savings,&#x201D; a client from Pennsylvania &#x201C;was now wide awaken,&#x201D; a Mossack Fonseca staff member wrote. &#x201C;I could even detect sweats coming down from his forehead and his cheeks were beginning to blush with crimson excitement. Noticing his interest, I went in for the kill.&#x201D;</p><h4 class=\"story-subheading story-content\">Black Hole for Assets</h4><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">In 2006, using a secret email account set up by Mossack Fonseca so his correspondence would not be traced by the authorities, a businessman from Washington State <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2852331-How-Can-I-Set-Up-a-Secret-Account-Redacted.html\">asked a common question</a> among the firm&#x2019;s potential American clients:</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#x201C;How does a US citizen legally get funds to Panama without the knowledge of the US government and how can those funds be profitably invested without the US government knowing about them?&#x201D;</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-6\">The reply came from Rams&#xE9;s Owens, then a partner who helped run the firm&#x2019;s trust division, offering clients &#x201C;effective solutions to enhance your privacy, protect your wealth.&#x201D; Mr. Owens laid out a basic menu of services: a package deal setting up an offshore company in what he promised would be a relatively cheap and quick transaction.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#x201C;We have right now a special offer by which we create a Private Foundation/company combination for a flat fee of US$4,500.00,&#x201D; Mr. Owens said. &#x201C;It includes Charter Documents, Regulations, nominee officers and directors, bank account and management of funds, provision of authorized signatories, neutral phone and fax numbers and mail forwarding services for both the private foundation and its underlying company.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">With this legal structure in place, Mr. Owens went on to explain, any money placed in these accounts would essentially go into a black hole.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#x201C;If we create a Private Foundation and the underlying company for you, the funds become completely private (US cannot know) as soon as the funds are deposited under a bank account or investment account in the name of the underlying company or the private foundation,&#x201D; <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2852331-How-Can-I-Set-Up-a-Secret-Account-Redacted.html#document/p6/a300140\">he wrote</a>.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The benefits of such an arrangement were numerous, he added, detailing how the client could effectively evade United States tax laws while protecting himself &#x2014; and the firm.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#x201C;You can take the money in cash, you can do a bad investment; you can purchase something and not receive anything (an expensive piano, an expensive software),&#x201D; <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2852331-How-Can-I-Set-Up-a-Secret-Account-Redacted.html#document/p3/a300141\">Mr. Owens wrote</a>. &#x201C;You can receive an invoice from Panama or any other location and that would justify some of the outgoing moneys. You can also declare everything to the tax administration.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#x201C;Any decision you make, please be aware that you will have to sign a &#x2018;disclaimer&#x2019; to us. We can only &#x2018;suggest,&#x2019; but the final decision to take the money out of the country is fully yours, and under the professional opinion of someone in USA.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">This was the sort of menu sold to the Ponsoldt family &#x2014; in a very big way.</p><figure id=\"media-100000004452540\" class=\"media photo embedded layout-small-vertical media-100000004452540\">\n    \n    <div class=\"image\">\n            <img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/06/us/06panama3/06panama3-superJumbo.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"media-viewer-candidate\">\n            <meta value=\"184\">\n            <meta value=\"180\">\n    </div>\n        <figcaption class=\"caption\">\n                <span class=\"caption-text\">William R.

They do, however, allow the investors who &#x201C;contribute&#x201D; their financing to shield themselves from legal claims in the United States.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">In secret meetings documented in the Panama Papers, Mossack Fonseca named the Ponsoldt family as the beneficiary, through the foundation, of the money placed in bank accounts around the world.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Among the early requests: confidentially transfer $800,000 from &#x201C;father&#x201D; to &#x201C;son,&#x201D; meaning moving the money to yet another offshore account &#x2014; called LBFH of Panama &#x2014; which Mossack Fonseca had set up on Christopher Ponsoldt&#x2019;s behalf with bank accounts in Andorra and Panama.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-8\">One motivation for Christopher Ponsoldt to stash money overseas in accounts not traceable to him: He owned a dirt racetrack in Florida, and he was concerned racers &#x201C;may get hurt and might then try to sue him for damages,&#x201D; the law firm notes on his case file said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#x201C;Please notify me when the money is deposited in American dollars,&#x201D; <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2850951-Master-Ponsoldt-6-2-700.html#document/p13/a300102\">Christopher Ponsoldt wrote to the law firm</a> a few months after his father&#x2019;s accounts had been set up and $800,000 was in the process of being transferred to another offshore account Christopher Ponsoldt controlled via the firm. &#x201C;I want to have U.S. dollars, Australian Dollars, Indian Real&#x2019;s and some kind of China index, to be determined.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Mossack Fonseca agreed to &#x201C;prepare a service agreement&#x201D; between two of the legal entities it managed for the family, to make it look as if there were an actual expenditure of money for a business purpose.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#x201C;After receiving the money, we will explain to them the nature of this transaction without giving details of your name,&#x201D; <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2850951-Master-Ponsoldt-6-2-700.html#document/p18/a300143\">the firm explained to William Ponsoldt</a>, regarding the Caribbean bank through which the money was moving to his son. &#x201C;Please let us know if you agree with this and if you will instruct the relevant parties to execute the wire transfer.&#x201D;</p><figure id=\"06panama-quote1\" class=\"interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-small\">\n    \n    \n    <figcaption class=\"interactive-caption\">\n            </figcaption>\n\n        \n    \n    \n</figure>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Federal law generally limits such tax-free transfers between family members to $14,000 a year. But for this transfer, described as a &#x201C;pre-inheritance distribution,&#x201D; the documents give no indication that any United States gift taxes were paid, as would most likely have been required, said Jack Blum, a lawyer and expert in international tax evasion who served for more than a decade as a consultant to the <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/\">Internal Revenue Service</a>.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#x201C;This is one way in which people with a lot of money step away from being average,&#x201D; Mr. Blum said after reviewing the documents.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Christopher Ponsoldt declined to comment. &#x201C;I am sorry, I can&#x2019;t help you,&#x201D; he said before hanging up.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Tracey Ponsoldt Powers, William Ponsoldt&#x2019;s daughter, approached the firm in October 2008 with an urgent request for help in secretly moving some of her family&#x2019;s money to Panama and then into gold coins. She feared political developments at home.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-9\">&#x201C;I feel VERY unsettled with this election and how the media is censoring information and spinning the American Public to vote Obama,&#x201D; <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2850951-Master-Ponsoldt-6-2-700.html#document/p28/a299968\">she wrote to Mr. Owens</a> at Mossack Fonseca. &#x201C;It is so obvious to me, that they are setting us up with a Socialist &#x2014; but most people can&#x2019;t see it happening before their eyes! It&#x2019;s like propaganda that is brainwashing Americans to forget the Principles of Hard Work, Ingenuity, Risk and Boundless Success!&#x201D;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Mr. Owens suggested shifting the money into a &#x201C;charity&#x201D; account, controlled by the firm on the family&#x2019;s behalf, in increments of less than $100,000, so it would not be detected.</p><figure id=\"media-100000004452893\" class=\"media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000004452893\">\n    \n    <div class=\"image\">\n            <img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/06/us/06panama-tear2/06panama-tear2-superJumbo.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"media-viewer-candidate\">\n            <meta value=\"259\">\n            <meta value=\"675\">\n    </div>\n        <figcaption class=\"caption\">\n                <span class=\"caption-text\">Tracey Ponsoldt Powers, code-named &#x201C;daughter,&#x201D; approached Mossack Fonseca in October 2008 because she was concerned about the potential election of Barack Obama as president.&#x200B; Around then, William Ponsoldt had the firm move $100,000 to a Swiss account for his daughter.</span>\n                    </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Separately, that same month, William Ponsoldt moved $100,000 from a company Mossack Fonseca controlled on his behalf into the name of his daughter.

We will treat you with the same esteem and conditions and service as the family is used to.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The subsequent series of complicated transfers &#x2014; money from the account would eventually be used by Mossack Fonseca in 2013 at Ms. Powers&#x2019;s request to buy real estate &#x2014; would be a challenge for American enforcement authorities, Mr. Blum said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#x201C;Simply by constructing all this in such a complex way, they make it extremely hard for enforcement officials to ever have resources to reconstruct what taxes should have been paid,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;What this is all about is obscuring the trail.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Ms. Powers did not respond to a series of calls and emails, and then declined to answer questions when reached on a cellphone.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#x201C;I have no idea what you are talking about,&#x201D; she said before hanging up.</p><h4 class=\"story-subheading story-content\">&#x2018;Live This Potential Risk&#x2019;</h4><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Across the United States, Mossack Fonseca picked up clients who had similarly urgent and delicate demands.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">For more than 30 years as the founder of Boston Capital Ventures, Harald Joachim von der Goltz has built a reputation as a savvy investor in emerging companies.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-10\">What few know, however, is that over roughly that same span of time and with the help of Mossack Fonseca, Mr. von der Goltz has also come to command a vast offshore empire: interconnected corporations, foundations and bank accounts with about $70 million in assets, according to internal emails.</p> <figure id=\"document-von-der-goltz-mossack-fonseca\" class=\"interactive promo  layout-small\">\n        <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/06/03/us/document-von-der-goltz-mossack-fonseca.html\">\n        \n        <div class=\"interactive-image-container\">\n            <div class=\"interactive-image\">\n                <img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/06/us/06panama-document-promo-goeltz/06panama-document-promo-goeltz-master180.png\">\n            </div>\n            <p class=\"interactive-overlay\">\n                <i class=\"icon sprite-icon interactive-overlay-icon\"></i>\n                                <span class=\"interactive-overlay-text\">\n                    OPEN Document                </span>\n                            </p>\n        </div>\n\n                \n            </a>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">A lawyer for Mr. von der Goltz said the beneficial owner of all of the trusts and accounts is Mr. von der Goltz&#x2019;s 100-year-old mother, who resides in Guatemala. One document also suggests that the tens of millions of dollars in the accounts originally came from businesses operated by Mr. von der Goltz&#x2019;s father.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">But numerous other documents prepared by Mossack Fonseca and signed by Mr. von der Goltz list him as the founder, manager and &#x201C;first beneficiary&#x201D; of the foundation that controls most of the family&#x2019;s wealth. Mr. von der Goltz also put assets from companies he helped operate into the accounts, documents show.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Most important, Mossack Fonseca registered Mr. von der Goltz as a resident of Guatemala, which tax experts said could help him protect the family money from certain United States tax obligations.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#x201C;MF Trust has registered Harald Joachim von der Goltz as a client of Guatemala.

She hadn&#x2019;t given him anything,&#x201D; the email said, providing an account for Mr. von der Goltz at Esp&#xED;rito Santo Bank in Miami.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#x201C;Ohh, yes, I know ERIKA wants it to be done quickly, we will proceed,&#x201D; Mr. Owens responded before confirming that the money should be moved as requested.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Legal experts consulted by The Times said it was difficult to determine definitively if the arrangements related to Mr. von der Goltz violated United States laws. But they said such moves were commonly used by investors seeking to hide their assets and evade federal taxes.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#x201C;There is reason to question if she was really directing that shift of money,&#x201D; Mr. Blum said, referring to Mr. von der Goltz&#x2019;s mother.</p><figure id=\"06panama-quote2\" class=\"interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-small\">\n    \n    \n    <figcaption class=\"interactive-caption\">\n            </figcaption>\n\n        \n    \n    \n</figure>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">In a statement, Mr. von der Goltz said the companies were established for legal purposes, and that both he and the companies were compliant with United States tax and reporting requirements.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#x201C;There has never been any illegal activity associated with these companies,&#x201D; the statement said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Other case files examined by The Times show how Mossack Fonseca may have turned a blind eye in the vetting process while helping Kjell Gunnar Finstad, a Texas resident, set up an oil company offshore in 2013.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-12\">Mossack Fonseca has long maintained that it will not work for individuals with criminal records or whose conduct raises &#x201C;red flags&#x201D; during its due-diligence process. But the firm somehow either missed or overlooked Mr. Finstad&#x2019;s past when it conducted a background search of potential directors for the new offshore oil company, OK Terra Energy, which was run out of Houston but registered in the British Virgin Islands.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Three years earlier, Mr. Finstad, the company&#x2019;s controlling partner and lead investor, had been convicted in Norway for various breaches of securities and accounting laws involving a company called Norex Group. The case was major news in Norway.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The records examined by The Times show that Mossack Fonseca collected a copy of Mr. Finstad&#x2019;s passport, and conducted a basic internet search and a cursory background check. But there is no mention of the fraud case, and no discussion of whether to proceed with setting up the new company, in light of Mr. Finstad&#x2019;s involvement.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Reached at his office in Texas and asked about the Panama Papers, Mr. Finstad said only, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want to talk about that.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">For another client, Mossack Fonseca offered a special service for a premium price.</p><figure id=\"media-100000004452888\" class=\"media photo embedded layout-small-vertical media-100000004452888\">\n    \n    <div class=\"image\">\n            <img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/06/us/06panama5/06panama5-superJumbo.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"media-viewer-candidate\">\n            <meta value=\"271\">\n            <meta value=\"180\">\n    </div>\n        <figcaption class=\"caption\">\n                <span class=\"caption-text\">Marianna Olszewski, a New York-based author, shifted $1 million to an overseas account through Mossack Fonseca.</span>\n                        \n            </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Marianna Olszewski, the New York City-based author of &#x201C;<a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9966538-live-it-love-it-earn-it\">Live It, Love It, Earn It:</a><a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9966538-live-it-love-it-earn-it\"> A Woman&#x2019;s Guide to Financial Freedom</a>,&#x201D; wanted to shift $1 million held by HSBC in Guernsey to a new overseas account. The catch? She did not want her name to appear anywhere near the transaction.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Mr. Owens, the Mossack Fonseca lawyer, again offered a solution.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Mossack Fonseca would locate what he called a &#x201C;natural person nominee&#x201D; in a &#x201C;tax-convenient&#x201D; jurisdiction to stand in for Ms. Olszewski as the owner of the account.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#x201C;The Natural Person Trustee is a service which is very sensitive,&#x201D; Mr. Owens wrote. &#x201C;We need to hire the Natural Person Nominee, pay him, make him sign lots of documents to cover us, make him sign resignations, make him get some proofs evidencing that he has the economic capacity to place such amount of moneys, letters of reference, proof of domicile, etc., etc.&#x201D; The process, he suggested, would cost her at least $17,500.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Ms. Olszewski approved the maneuver &#x2014; only to see the firm, at one point, accidentally disclose her name to the banks involved.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-13\">&#x201C;Ramses, Please call me ASAP!!

This is not good and I asked you NOT to do this! this is why we have this structure.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Mr. Owens sought to calm her down, saying that Mossack Fonseca could tell the bank that the natural person nominee actually controlled the account. &#x201C;This can be solved,&#x201D;

or something like this.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The use of a stand-in to hide the true ownership of an account is one of the remaining illegal ploys favored by Americans today as international banks, under pressure from the United States, demand proof of account ownership, said <a href=\"http://mnrlawfirm.com/attorneys/jeffrey-neiman/\">Jeffrey Neiman</a>, a former federal prosecutor from Miami who specialized in criminal tax offenses, adding that he could not comment directly on this case. &#x201C;The fact that a law firm was willing to do this legitimizes the process for their clients,&#x201D; he said.</p><h4 class=\"story-subheading story-content\">A Firm&#x2019;s Inner Doubts</h4><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Many of the client files &#x2014; like those for Mr. Weill, the banker; Mr. Soriano, the ballplayer; and Mr. Akridge, the developer &#x2014; contain little information on the purpose of the offshore accounts, or how they were used after they were set up, making it impossible, based on the records available, to assess whether they were used legitimately.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-14\">But the experts who reviewed some of the documents related to the Ponsoldts, Mr. von der Goltz and Ms. Olszewski said that the firm itself seemed to realize it was taking risks.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#x201C;They were not always sure themselves which side of the line they were on at any given moment,&#x201D; said Ross S. Delston, a former federal banking regulator who now specializes in combating money-laundering efforts. &#x201C;It is apparent that members of the firm were aware they were treading very close to the line.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">In fact, the files contain instances, beginning before the Panama Papers came to light, of Mossack Fonseca lawyers second-guessing their actions. (In recent weeks, the firm has shut down <a href=\"https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/05/27/19740/mossack-fonsecas-us-operations-cut-back-after-nevada-penalty\">many of its operations in Nevada</a>, as well as British locations in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mossfon/status/736287517922598912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">Jersey and the Isle of Man</a>, and is <a href=\"http://www.prensa.com/in_english/Investigacion-detiene-SMV_21_4489261030.html\">closing the asset-management division</a> that served many of its United States clients.)</p><figure id=\"06panama-quote3\" class=\"interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-small\">\n    \n    \n    <figcaption class=\"interactive-caption\">\n            </figcaption>\n\n        \n    \n    \n</figure>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">In 2013, Mossack Fonseca advised Ms. Olszewski to seek outside counsel and consider reporting herself to the I.R.S., warning of possible &#x201C;severe&#x201D; repercussions if she did not. The warning came in the wake of a Justice Department investigation of the role that certain Swiss banks had played in helping United States citizens evade federal taxes.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Records show that Mossack Fonseca had been paid at least $102,000 over nine years to help Ms. Olszewski handle various transactions.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Ms. Olszewski took the firm&#x2019;s advice, and belatedly disclosed her accounts to the I.R.S., the documents show. And by 2014, she asked Mossack Fonseca to shut down her accounts and offshore entities, which collectively held at least $1.7 million.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m in complete compliance with all my U.S. tax and reporting requirements,&#x201D; Ms. Olszewski said in an emailed statement when The Times asked about the accounts.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\"><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2850950-Master-Olszewski-June-2-6-51.html#document/p23/a300069\">In a second statement</a>, she said she had relied on the advice of legal counsel to establish a trust for her family while living abroad. &#x201C;I am confident that I have acted properly,&#x201D; she added, &#x201C;and any insinuation otherwise is false.&#x201D;</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-15\">Reached by telephone in late May, Mr. Owens, who is no longer with the law firm, said only, &#x201C;Regretfully, I cannot speak about individual clients or my time at Mossack Fonseca.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Mossack Fonseca sent a series of similar and increasingly dire warnings to the Ponsoldts in 2013 and 2014, telling them that they had to provide a Swiss bank with documentation that they had paid all required United States taxes &#x2014; or face possible investigation.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#x201C;Neither your ex Trustees nor us would like to be involved into any measure the US Department of Justice might try to enforce,&#x201D; <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2850951-Master-Ponsoldt-6-2-700.html#document/p43/a299974\">the firm wrote</a>. &#x201C;In this regard, again we strongly urge you to take the necessary steps to avoid any negative consequences for you as well as us.&#x201D;</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The records examined by The Times give no indication whether the Ponsoldts complied, and family members would not say when asked.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know what you are talking about,&#x201D; Christopher Ponsoldt said in a second brief conversation before he again hung up.</p><footer class=\"story-footer story-content\">\n    \n    </footer>\n        <a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/06/us/panama-papers.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news#whats-next\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n    </div>\n    \n</div>",
