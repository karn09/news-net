## Setup & Usage

First, make sure to install any dependencies with:
```bash
npm install
```

To build the project, simply run:
```bash
gulp
```
This will also watch for any file changes, updating the service worker and public folder accordingly.

To run
```bash
npm start
```

This will create a server at [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337)

Use CTRL + C to shut down the server if you'd like to test offline functionality.
